# Coding Exercise for NWEA

## Challenge Instructions:

Given a nested list of integers, implement a function to flatten it. Each
element is either an integer, or a list -- whose elements may also be integers
or other lists. Provide a github gist link to your code and tests. You may use
whatever language you are comfortable with but do not use any built-in
flattening functions that provide this functionality like Rubyâ€™s list.flatten

### There are no additional requirements beyond vanilla python3.

Run tests:
   > `python3 tests.py`
